### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a static temperature converter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will allow users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin through an interactive interface. The website will be hosted on Google Cloud Storage to demonstrate static web hosting capabilities. This project emphasizes the integration of front-end technologies with cloud-based deployment solutions.

### Key Activities
- **Developing the Website**: Design and implement a temperature converter interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enable user-friendly conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- **Testing Functionality**: Ensure accurate temperature conversion calculations and verify the responsiveness and compatibility of the website across different devices.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Host the static website on Google Cloud Storage, configure storage buckets, and set up permissions for seamless public access.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page content.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the temperature conversion logic and interactivity.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: For hosting the static website.

### Deployment
Host the static website on Google Cloud Storage for public access.

### Outcome
Demonstrate the integration of cloud hosting with interactive static webÂ applications.
